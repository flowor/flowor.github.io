### The Situation
My high school offered multiple lunch plans. A Monday-Wednesday-Friday plan and an everyday plan. They used a paper list of students to check them off by their name as they walked through the line. It was a rather slow and tedious process.

### The Solution
Each student already had their own id card with a unique barcode. I implemented a system where students would scan their card as they walk through the line and the program would show the student's information (Student ID, Name, Grade, Lunch Plan). Everything is stored in a MySQL database.
