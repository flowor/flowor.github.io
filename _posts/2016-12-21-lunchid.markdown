### The Situation
My Highschool offered multiple lunch plans. A Monday-Wednesday-Friday plan, and an everyday plan. They had a paper list of students and would check students off by their name as they walked through the line. It was a rather slow and tedious process.

### The Solution
Each student already had their own id card with each containing a unique barcode. I implemented a system where students scanned their card as they walked through the line. The program shows the student's information (Student ID, Name, Grade, Lunch Plan) as listed in a MySql database and logs the action.
